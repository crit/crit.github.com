		<h1>Fun Day/Cardio Day</h1>

		<p>Choose an activity you enjoy doing. Basketball. Hiking. Etc. Perform for 70 minutes. If you do not

		have this option for the day, simply do cardio. To “spice” it up, perform body weight exercises

		within your cardio time. (Example: run for 70 minutes. However, every 10 minutes, you must stop

		and perform 30 pushups.)</p>
